# Scoring method

PRAF converts each indicator's inputs into a normalised **0–100 risk index**
per domain, then classifies each domain against two thresholds.

## 1. Per-indicator inputs

Every indicator is scored from four inputs, each mapped to a 1–5 scale where
**higher always means more risk**:

| Input | Scale | Meaning of a high value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Response | 1–5 | See *polarity* below |
| Likelihood (L) | 1–5 | More likely to occur |
| Impact (I) | 1–5 | More severe consequence |
| Detectability (D) | 1–5 | **Harder to detect** (FMEA convention) |

> **Detectability convention.** Following FMEA, a *higher* detectability value
> means the problem is *harder* to catch before it causes harm, and therefore
> *increases* risk. `5` = effectively undetectable, `1` = obvious/immediately
> caught. This is the opposite of "how detectable is it".

### Polarity

The meaning of the response depends on the indicator's **polarity**:

- **Risk when absent** (protective control, e.g. *"Are design assumptions
  documented?"*): an affirmative answer means the control exists, so risk is
  **low**. The raw yes/no axis (yes = 5, no = 1) is inverted to `6 − raw`.
- **Risk when present** (hazard level, e.g. *"Is there single-source
  dependency?"*): an affirmative / high answer means risk is **high**. The raw
  axis is used directly.

## 2. Composite severity

The four scaled inputs are averaged and normalised to `0–1`:

```
base     = (Response + L + I + D) / 4          # 1..5
severity = (base - 1) / 4                       # 0..1
```

## 3. Within-domain weighting

Two weights vary *between* indicators of the same domain and so shape the
domain's aggregate:

```
w = nature_modifier × indicator_base_weight
```

- **nature_modifier** weights structural/governance risks above purely technical
  ones.
- **indicator_base_weight** is the indicator's intrinsic importance.

The indicator's weighted contribution is `severity × w`.

The **domain_weight** is deliberately *not* included here — it is constant
across every indicator in a domain and is applied later (step 5), because a
constant factor would cancel out of the normalised mean below and have no
effect.

## 4. Base domain index (0–100)

A domain's base index is the **weight-normalised mean** of its indicators'
severities, scaled to 0–100:

```
base_index = 100 × Σ(severity_i × w_i) / Σ(w_i)
```

Because it is normalised by the total weight, the index is always in
`[0, 100]` regardless of how many indicators a domain has or how large their
weights are. A domain of all-worst-case indicators scores 100; all-best scores
0. The same formula produces the category-level base indices.

## 4b. Context-aware domain weighting

The **domain_weight** is activity-dependent: the selected activity raises the
weight of the domains it emphasises (e.g. *supplier selection* raises the
supply-chain domain weight to 1.35, *regulatory preparation* raises regulatory
compliance to 1.40). It is applied as a sensitivity multiplier on the base
index and capped at 100:

```
index = min(100, base_index × domain_weight)
```

This means the same answers produce a higher risk index — and can cross into a
higher classification band — for the domains an activity makes most relevant.
Weights ≥ 1 only ever raise sensitivity; they never suppress risk.

## 5. Classification

Each domain index is classified against two thresholds (defaults shown):

| Index | Level | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `< 40` | acceptable | proceed |
| `40 – <70` | action_required | revise |
| `≥ 70` | escalation_required | escalate |

The overall decision is the most severe domain decision.

The thresholds (`40` / `70`) are the framework's **default risk-acceptability
criteria**. They are a design-stage governance policy, **not** a validated
clinical threshold, and are configurable per project via `Defaults`. An inverted
pair (`low ≥ high`) is rejected at construction time rather than silently
flipping the classification.

## 6. High-severity safeguard

The domain index in step 4 is a *mean*, so a single catastrophic-severity hazard
can be numerically diluted by low-scoring neighbours or a low likelihood. This
conflicts with the ISO 14971 principle that severity of harm is the primary
driver of risk.

To counter this, an explicit **severity guard** runs *after* classification and
can only ever **raise** a domain's level (never lower it):

| Condition (on the scaled 1–5 axes) | Minimum resulting level |
| --- | --- |
| Impact = 5 **and** Likelihood ≥ 4 | escalation_required |
| Impact = 5 (any likelihood) | action_required |

Every override is recorded in the audit trail with the triggering indicator and
reason, so the escalation is fully traceable. The trigger values have the same
governance-default status as the thresholds above and are configurable.

## 7. Known limitations

These are documented deliberately; they bound what a result may be relied on for.

- The four axes (Response, L, I, D) are **averaged with equal weight**. The
  severity guard (§6) is the minimum-severity backstop for this, but the base
  index still treats impact as one quarter of the signal. Detectability is an
  FMEA concept included as a contributing axis, not part of the ISO 14971
  Severity × Probability product.
- Missing inputs are scored with the **neutral default (3)** so the pipeline
  still runs, but every gap is reported in `input_completeness` and surfaced by
  the CLI. A result over incomplete input must be read together with its
  completeness report.
- All weights and thresholds are **governance defaults, not empirically or
  clinically derived**. See `risk_management_approach.md` for validation status.
